# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer focused on mobile (iOS & Android) development for more than 10 years, based in Madrid (Spain).

## Full-stack iOS & Android engineer

Become iOS developer in 2011, using Objective-C. In 2014, I switched to Swift, the language I've been working with since then, to develop cross-platform applications (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS & visionOS), as well as backend applications (using the Vapor framework), and to build user interfaces with SwiftUI. In 2012, I made my first Android application with Java, transitioning to Kotlin in 2017. Currently, I develop applications with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Passionate about technology, I enjoy dedicating my free time to researching and continuing to learn to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in languages and key frameworks.
