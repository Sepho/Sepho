# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer focused on mobile (iOS & Android) development for more than 10 years, based in Madrid (Spain).

## Full-stack iOS & Android engineer

Become an iOS developer in 2011, using Objective-C. In 2014, I switched to Swift, the language I've been working with since then to develop cross-platform applications (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, and visionOS), as well as backend applications using [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) framework. In 2012, I created my first Android application with Java, transitioning to Kotlin in 2017. Currently developing native Android applications with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and SwiftUI for Apple ecosystem development.

Passionate about technology, I dedicate my free time to researching and learning to stay up-to-date with the latest APIs and key frameworks.
